This is the main package of the native c component.
<p>
    Here we define the API's and the VM singleton access to native c.
<p>
    The component itself was built, as we didn't (once again) find anything
    around that satisfied our needs. We wanted:
<ul>
    <li>Clean, layered design</li>
    <li>Unrestricted access to all modeled objects and concepts.</li>
    <li>Easy adaption and integration with other views. This means primarily unrestricted
        access to pointers. There is no use in a native library if i can't bootstrap
        with a simple address (in our point of view).
    </li>
    <li>Clean design for c data structures (primitive, composites and references)</li>
    <li>Exchangeable native implementation</li>
    <li>Platform independence</li>
</ul>

So we created an API and a data structure component and mapped it to JNA, which has
great ideas (but in our opinion is to sealed off and has not well done on the
data structure side) and can serve as a good foundation.

There are some topics we didn't care about yet - this means they may be working or may
not, its simply not tested. JNA brings a lot of basic features...

<ul>
    <li>Pointer size was not really an issue</li>
    <li>We didn't care about byte order</li>
</ul>

64 bit implementation is under way.
